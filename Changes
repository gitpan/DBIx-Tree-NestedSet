Changes in DBIx::Tree::NestedSet 0.13 

Fixed the return value from the add_* methods. Sigh. It should now properly return the id.
Fixed get_hashref_of_info_by_id_with_level() to actually work.

Changes in DBIx::Tree::NestedSet 0.12 

Fixed get_parents_flat(), which shift()ed when it should've pop()ed.
Documentation fixes. Added "THANKS".
Increased efficiency of delete_self_and_children() and delete_children() with SQL from Hansen at www.perlmonks.org. Thanks!
Added get_hashref_of_info_by_id_with_level()
Fixed DBIx::Tree::NestedSet::SQLite to recreate indeces upon alteration.

Changes in DBIx::Tree::NestedSet 0.11

Removed the DBI::disconnect() and "unlock tables" statement in DESTROY(). Oops.
Added some missing DBI::finish()es.
Abstracted out the RDBMS-specific stuff into separate driver classes. See "DBIx::Tree::NestedSet::MySQL" for an example. Should make "porting" to different RDBMSs very easy.
Created "DBIx::Tree::NestedSet::MySQL" and "DBIx::Tree::NestedSet::SQLite" driver classes. If you wanted to create a driver class for another RDBMS, you should probably look at source of the MySQL class first.
Created "create_default_table" and "get_default_create_table_statement" methods that call to the RDBMS driver classes.
