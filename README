========================
 
See the module documentation for more information.
 
INSTALLATION
 
To install this module type the following:
 
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
 
DEPENDENCIES
 
This module requires DBI for normal usage.  

It requires CGI::Application and HTML::Template if you want to use the 
included "helper class," DBIx::Tree::NestedSet::Manage, which
provides a CGI interface to your tree.

NOTES

This module has been tested on MySQL versions 4.0.18 and 3.23.49 and SQLite 2.x.
Porting it to another RDBMS should be trivial, given the existence of RDBMS
specific driver classes that abstract out non-portable SQL. 

This module *does not work* with SQLite version 3. It segfaults.

If you're using this module successfully on another system, please let me know
AND SEND IN YOUR DRIVER CLASS! Please. It's how CPAN gets better.
